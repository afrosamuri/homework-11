# homework-11
I signed a petition to abolish the SAT. As a junior in highschool the SAT is one of the most stressfull tests that im preparing for.
It is known that some people are just not test takers. I am one of them. Now because of my inability to take tests
there is a very real possibility that colleges wont accept me. This system is screwed up and wrong to force upon those
who dont do well with the SAT.
